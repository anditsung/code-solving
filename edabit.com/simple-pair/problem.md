Mubashir needs your help to write a simple algorithm of multiplication.

Given an array of integers $arr and an integer $n, find out a pair of numbers [x, y] from a given array such that x * y = n .

If the pair is not found, return null.

Examples

simplePair([1, 2, 3], 3) ➞ [1, 3]

simplePair([1, 2, 3], 6) ➞ [2, 3]

simplePair([1, 2, 3], 9) ➞ null
